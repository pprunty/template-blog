I'm a senior software engineer at UnitedHealth Group, currently based in Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland.

To arrive where I am today, I took the road less traveled. I was never top of my class, the best athlete, or even the most social. But I come from a family that preach hard work pays off.

After high school, I spent a year working in construction with my father. I then decided to pursue further education through a joint honors degree in English Literature and Mathematics—English because it is my natural strength, and Mathematics for the doors it would open.

Fast-forward some years, I completed a MSc. in High-Performance Computing, gaining expertise in GPU technologies, low-level programming, and parallel computing before these became foundational to technologies like Bitcoin and ChatGPT.

Today, I work as a full-stack software engineer, developing healthcare solutions that improve people's lives. My role bridges technical expertise with business acumen—building modern web applications using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Python FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) while working closely with business teams to deliver highly competitive products.

Outside work, you'll find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending time with loved ones. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickprunty/) or via [E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com). My door is always open. ☕️
