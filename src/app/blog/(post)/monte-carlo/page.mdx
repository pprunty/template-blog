I used to think integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into my Software as a Service (SaaS) entrepreneurial projects
was cheating.
Then I built
Magikarp, an AI agent, named after a fish-type Pokémon, that turned my skepticism into a wake-up call for the future of software development.
In just 11 hours, I created an AI agent that could do the work of an entire data science team.

So, what is Magikarp?

## An Unconventional Interview Experience

It started with an unconventional interview for a software developer position at a mobile device startup. Instead of
the trivial coding test, which usually has little relevance to actual on-the-job tasks,
the company assigned me a take-home project aimed at solving one of their
core strategic problems:

> Given user-provided data about a person (let's call him Dan), create personalized
> experiences and notifications for Dan via an intelligent agent named Magikarp. This agent resides on Dan's device and
> has contextual knowledge of his data stored locally on the device.

Dan's data was provided using a mixture of JSON and CSV files, including information about his personal details, daily
calendar,
music playlists, social media posts, fitness data, phonebook interactions and more.

Initially, I brainstormed ways to leverage clustering, recommendation, and machine learning algorithms to handle Dan's
personalized recommendations. I even created
Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams for data ingestion of different file types. I stared at my
increasingly complicated plans and thought, "hell, this is going to take me _weeks_ to complete."

Then I remembered...

The recruiter hinted in the initial screening how the company are exploring the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs, e.g. ChatGPT) on their mobile devices.

This led me to pivot my approach entirely.

## Large Language Models in Motion

After some research, I discovered [Meta's Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/), a sophisticated and
open-sourced LLM. Together with the [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) library, I configured the Llama 3 model
for my specific
use-case; in a similar fashion to how one uses OpenAI's "Create your own GPT" feature. This allowed me to create the
Magikarp agent on top of Llama 3 and achieve the following:

1. **LLM Prompting:** Enabled Dan to interact with Magikarp, with responses curated using Dan's contextual data.

2. **Smart Push-Notifications:** Developed a system to send personalized, non-invasive notifications based on Dan's
   daily schedule and preferences.

3. **Rule-based User Configuration:** Allowed customization of Magikarp’s interactions, giving users control over
   response styles and notifications.

To manage interactions between the user and Magikarp, I used [Python FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to create
three backend APIs to demonstrate the above capabilities and a simple interface. This allowed users to communicate with
the Magikarp agent on the backend and view its responses directly in their browser.

Watch the demo video
I [created here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AjILMCiRm8YwZPQLncvkX8y0AuZF2MpE/view?usp=sharing) to see Magikarp in
action. This demo showcases Magikarp's contextual understanding and ability to provide personalized recommendations.

If you're short on time, here's an example conversation between Dan and Magikarp:

```text
>>> Hello there.
Hey! It's me, Magikarp! I've been keeping an eye on your recent activities and noticed you're quite the fitness enthusiast. With over 8,500 steps today, that's impressive! You must be feeling great after that 5K run. By the way, have you checked out Nicolas Jaar's new album? I heard it's a masterpiece!

What's on your mind today?

>>> How many steps do I have left to do today in order to hit my steps goal?
According to your fitness data, you've already taken 8500 steps today. Your average daily step goal is 9000 steps. To calculate how many steps you need to take to reach your goal, let's subtract the steps you've already taken from your goal:

9000 (average daily step goal) - 8500 (steps taken so far) = 500

>>> Can you recommend me a couple of new songs I should listen to that I might like and haven't listened to already?
Hey there! As Magikarp, I've got my fins on your music taste. Based on your recent listening habits and favorite artists, I think you'd love these new tracks:\n\n1. **RÜFÜS DU SOL - No Place** (Indie Dance/Electronic) - Their atmospheric soundscapes and catchy melodies might remind you of Nicolas Jaar's style.\n2. **Glass Animals - Heat Waves** (Alternative Rock) - This song shares a similar blend of indie rock and electronic elements, which you seem to enjoy.\n\nGive them a spin and let me know what you think!

>>> Can you be short and snappy in your responses when talking with me?
Hey there! I'm Magikarp, here to help. Got it - short and snappy, got it!

>>> So, what's my calendar looking like for today?
According to your calendar, you have a busy day ahead of you. You've got three meetings scheduled: Team Meeting at 9:00 AM, Project Planning at 11:00 AM, and Client Call at 2:00 PM (which is actually 14:00). Make sure to review the project plan before the meeting at 11:00 AM!
```

The result is a highly sophisticated, albeit slow, Magikarp agent. Admittedly, the solution surprised
even
myself. Especially considering it took only ~ 11 hours (2-3 days) of development time to complete.

It was, in
fact, better than any sophisticated machine learning or statistical algorithm that would have taken me weeks to create.
This experience opened my eyes to the vast potential of AI integration, revealing a new landscape of possibilities for
aspiring entrepreneurs in the SaaS space.

## Transforming Skepticism into Innovation

Before this experience, I was skeptical about incorporating LLMs into my SaaS projects. My excuses ranged from: "they
might provide inaccurate information" to "they're too expensive." Moreover, using LLMs felt like sort of like
_cheating_. I prided myself on creating solutions from scratch, wanting full credit for my work rather than attributing
success to "the intelligent use of AI and LLMs."

However, completing the Magikarp project transformed my perspective. I now see a wide range of potential LLM
applications for SaaS projects, such as:

- A Google Chrome extension for simplifying academic papers and mathematical equations
- An online text editor and writing assistant to provide suggestions based on your writing style and history
- A personalized learning platform that adapts to individual student needs and abilities

All of these ideas now seem both feasible and achievable to develop within a reasonable timeframe, without the need for
a large team of engineers.

## Leveraging AI as a Competitive Advantage

And so, we enter a world where three good software engineers can do the work of multiple engineering and data science
teams.

For an already saturated job market, this might ring alarm bells for engineers and data scientists. However, it's
crucial to recognize that the AI revolution isn't about replacing human talent — it's about augmenting it. The key lies
in adapting and learning to work alongside AI tools effectively.

You can get started by watching [3Blue1Brown's YouTube videos on LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M),
and then create a pilot project using the [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) library
and its [Python SDK](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python).

By embracing AI as a tool for innovation rather than a threat, SaaS entrepreneurs can gain a significant competitive
advantage in an increasingly AI-driven market.

## The Future of AI-Powered SaaS

As we look
to the future, it's crucial to understand the broader implications and challenges of AI adoption in the tech industry.

The integration of AI, particularly LLMs, has become a pivotal trend in the tech industry. For
many executives, AI has become a buzzword to impress stakeholders, intimidate competition, and motivate engineers. This
is likely why Product Managers are often eager to incorporate AI into development projects, sometimes without fully
considering its implications. However, simply connecting a SaaS product to an LLM's API
doesn't make it an _AI_ company.

The debate over AI's role in products is ongoing. In the wake of Apple's WWDC announcement about releasing a new Apple
AI, powered by OpenAI's GPT models, on iOS 18 devices later this year (2024), Marques
Brownlee [posted an interesting video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDIi95CqTiM&pp=ygUbYnJvd25sZWUgcHJvZHVjdCB2cyBmZWF0dXJl)
discussing whether AI should be considered a product in itself or merely a feature. This move by Apple exemplifies how
major tech companies are positioning AI as a core product feature, blurring the lines between product and feature.

<YouTube videoId="sDIi95CqTiM" />

As AI advancements continue and more companies jump on the bandwagon, the world is poised to see an influx of new AI-powered
products. However, not all of these will succeed. The winners in this new landscape will be those who can leverage AI
and LLM features most effectively, going beyond surface-level integration to create truly innovative solutions that
complement their core offerings.

The Magikarp project revealed that effective AI integration goes beyond technical implementation. It requires
understanding user needs, enhancing core features, balancing AI capabilities with user control, and continuous
refinement. By following this approach, SaaS entrepreneurs can create valuable AI-powered products that truly serve
their users, just as Magikarp did with its personalized interactions.

## Embracing AI in Your SaaS Journey

The takeaway lesson: don't get left behind. If you still hold a reluctance to leverage LLMs in your SaaS products,
then realize that your reluctance more than likely stems from your personal ego. As the technology continues to evolve
at a rapid
pace, ensure that you evolve with it. The next game-changing SaaS product could be just 11 hours of coding away.
